## Description
Welcome to the Coupon Landing Page, an innovative project designed to showcase and promote exciting discount offers. We've harnessed the power of HTML, CSS, and SCSS while following the principles of UX/UI design to create an engaging user experience. Our codebase is structured using the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology, ensuring modularity and maintainability.

Beyond aesthetics, we've meticulously crafted the user interface (UI) to captivate and guide users effectively. With hover effects and strategic CSS pseudo-classes, we've created an immersive browsing experience. Dive into our world of fantastic offers and enjoy seamless navigation through our visually appealing and user-friendly design.
